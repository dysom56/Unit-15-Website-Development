The client wants a website with five sections, including a company profile, profiles of existing trainee web developers,
job specifications and required qualifications, an online application form, and links to website development courses. 
I will achieve this by creating five pages with a similar look and making the company profile the home page. This way
people looking for jobs can get an idea of what the company is about and see if they would want to work there.

Colour schemes and typography:
I have decided to go with a black, white and grey colour scheme as it is very clean and professional, and the colours 
complement each other well. For typography, I decided to make the titles have a bigger font than the text under it so
that it stand out more. This allows for easier understanding of the page they are on and has better readability.
