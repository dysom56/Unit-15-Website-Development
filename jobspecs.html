              website as well as how it works. You may also be responsible for the maintenance of an existing site.
              The term web developer is sometimes used interchangeably with web designer, but this is misguided. Web
              developing is a more specialist role, focusing on the back-end development of a website, using programming
              languages to make the web design a reality that works well.

              web designer needing to ensure that web pages are responsive no matter what type of device is being used.
              Therefore, the need to test websites at different stages of design and on a variety of devices, has become
